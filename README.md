## About
Course Project for CS2433 (Principles of Programming Languages II) done under Dr. Saurabh Joshi, IIT Hyderabad. <br>
The project was done mainly to understand the concurrency patterns in Go. We have made extensive use of concurrent features of Go in both communication (between game server and the client) and gameplay. The project also utilises the Websockets protocol to enable low-latency bi-directional communication.
